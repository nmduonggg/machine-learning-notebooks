# Machine Learning notebooks

This repository contains some of my machine-learning notebooks. It may 
be varied in many machine learning fields because it kind of reflects my
learning process. There are some machine-learning fields that can be included
in this repository

## Image generation and processing
- Autoregressive model - PixelCNN using masked convolutional filters and residual block [Autoregressive model - PixelCNN](https://github.com/nmduonggg/machine-learning-notebooks/blob/main/pix2pix_cnn.ipynb)
  
## General machine learning
- Uncover bias in the dataset through learning latent space via reconstruction loss [Uncover bias via latent space](https://github.com/nmduonggg/machine-learning-notebooks/blob/main/uncovering-bias-through-latent-features.ipynb)
